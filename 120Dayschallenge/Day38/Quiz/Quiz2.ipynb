    "1. **Which of the following encoding techniques is used for categorical variables with no inherent ordering?**\n",
    "   - Ordinal Encoding\n",
    "   - Label Encoding\n",
    "   - Target Guided Ordinal Encoding\n",
    "   - None of the above\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Answer:** Label Encoding\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Explanation:** Label Encoding is used for categorical variables with no inherent ordering, where each unique category is assigned a unique integer value.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Which encoding technique is used when there is a natural ordering between the categories of a categorical variable?**\n",
    "   - Ordinal Encoding\n",
    "   - Label Encoding\n",
    "   - Target Guided Ordinal Encoding\n",
    "   - None of the above\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Answer:** Ordinal Encoding\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Explanation:** Ordinal Encoding is used for categorical variables with a natural ordering between the categories, where the categories are assigned integer values according to their order.\n",

    "3. **Covariance is a measure of:**\n",
    "   - The strength of the linear relationship between two variables\n",
    "   - The degree of association between two variables\n",
    "   - The direction of the relationship between two variables\n",
    "   - All of the above\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Answer:** All of the above\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Explanation:** Covariance measures both the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two variables and is a measure of the degree of association between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Correlation check is used to:**\n",
    "   - Determine the strength of the linear relationship between two variables\n",
    "   - Determine the direction of the relationship between two variables\n",
    "   - Determine the degree of association between two variables\n",

    "   - Ordinal Encoding\n",
    "   - Label Encoding\n",
    "   - Target Guided Ordinal Encoding\n",
    "   - Covariance\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Answer:** Label Encoding\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Explanation:** Label Encoding is most appropriate for a categorical variable with no natural ordering, as each unique category can be assigned a unique integer value.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **A dataset contains a categorical variable that is strongly associated with the target variable. Which encoding technique would be most appropriate for this variable?**\n",
    "   - Ordinal Encoding\n",
    "   - Label Encoding\n",
    "   - Target Guided Ordinal Encoding\n",
    "   - Covariance\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Answer:** Target Guided Ordinal Encoding\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Explanation:** Target Guided Ordinal Encoding would be most appropriate for a categorical variable that is strongly associated with the target variable, as it assigns ordinal values to categories based on the mean of the target variable for each category.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **A data scientist is performing feature engineering on a dataset with categorical variables. Which technique can be used to check the degree of association between two categorical variables?**\n",
