    "   - By using the select() method\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Answer:** By using the find() method\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Explanation:** To query documents from a collection in MongoDB using PyMongo in Python, use the find() method, which returns a cursor for iterating over matching documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **What is MongoDB?**\n",
    "   - A relational database management system\n",
    "   - A document-oriented database management system\n",
    "   - A graph database management system\n",
    "   - A key-value store database management system\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Answer:** A document-oriented database management system\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Explanation:** MongoDB is a document-oriented database management system that stores data as documents in BSON format, providing flexibility in data modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **What is a collection in MongoDB?**\n",

    "\n",
    "   **Answer:** A set of documents\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Explanation:** In MongoDB, a collection is a set of documents, equivalent to a table in relational databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **What is a document in MongoDB?**\n",
    "   - A row\n",
    "   - A tuple\n",
