    "1. **What is a common technique used for handling missing data in a dataset?**\n",
    "   - Dropping the rows with missing data\n",
    "   - Imputing the missing values with the mean value\n",
    "   - Ignoring the missing data and proceeding with analysis\n",
    "   - None of the above\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Answer:** Imputing the missing values with the mean value\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Explanation:** Mean imputation is a common technique used for handling missing data in a dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Why is it important to handle missing data before performing any analysis or modeling?**\n",
    "   - It can cause bias in the results\n",
    "   - It can lead to inaccurate predictions\n",
    "   - It can affect the generalizability of the model\n",
    "   - All of the above\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Answer:** All of the above\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Explanation:** Handling missing data is important because it can lead to bias in the results, inaccurate predictions, and affect the generalizability of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **What is imbalanced data?**\n",
    "   - A dataset with missing values\n",
    "   - A dataset with unequal distribution of classes\n",
    "   - A dataset with outliers\n",
    "   - A dataset with noisy data\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Answer:** A dataset with unequal distribution of classes\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **What is a common technique used for handling imbalanced data in a dataset?**\n",
    "   - Up-sampling the minority class\n",
    "   - Down-sampling the majority class\n",
    "   - Using cost-sensitive learning algorithms\n",
    "   - All of the above\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Answer:** All of the above\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Explanation:** Up-sampling, down-sampling, and using cost-sensitive learning algorithms are all common techniques used for handling imbalanced data in a dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **What is a common technique used for down-sampling a dataset?**\n",
    "   - Randomly selecting a subset of the majority class\n",
    "   - Creating a new class in the dataset\n",
    "   - Removing data from the minority class\n",
    "   - None of the above\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Answer:** Randomly selecting a subset of the majority class\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Explanation:** Down-sampling involves randomly selecting a subset of the majority class to balance the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **What metric is commonly used to evaluate the performance of a machine learning model on an imbalanced dataset?**\n",
    "   - Accuracy\n",
    "   - Precision\n",
    "   - Recall\n",
    "   - All of the above\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Answer:** All of the above\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Explanation:** Accuracy, precision, and recall are all commonly used metrics to evaluate the performance of a machine learning model on an imbalanced dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **You are working with a dataset that has missing values, and you decide to use mean imputation to fill in the missing values. What is a potential drawback to using mean imputation?**\n",
    "   - It can result in inaccurate imputed values\n",
    "   - It can be computationally expensive\n",
    "   - It can introduce bias into the analysis\n",
    "   - It can only be used for numerical data\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Answer:** It can introduce bias into the analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Explanation:** Mean imputation assumes that missing values are missing completely at random, which may not always be the case and can introduce bias.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **You are working on a project that requires predicting customer satisfaction. However, the dataset is imbalanced with a majority of customers being satisfied. What is a common technique you can use to down-sample the majority class and balance the dataset?**\n",
    "   - Random undersampling\n",
    "   - Random oversampling\n",
    "   - SMOTE\n",
    "   - ADASYN\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Answer:** Random undersampling\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Explanation:** This technique involves randomly selecting instances from the majority class to match the number of instances in the minority class.\n"
