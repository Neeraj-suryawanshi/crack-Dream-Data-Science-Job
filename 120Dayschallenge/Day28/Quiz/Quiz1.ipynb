    "### 1. Which type of probability distribution is used to model the number of successes in a fixed number of independent trials?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Binomial Distribution\n",
    "- Poisson Distribution\n",
    "- Normal Distribution\n",
    "- Exponential Distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** Binomial Distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** Binomial distribution is used to model the number of successes in a fixed number of independent trials, where each trial has only two possible outcomes (success or failure).\n",
    "\n",

    "- Binomial Distribution\n",
    "- Poisson Distribution\n",
    "- Normal Distribution\n",
    "- Exponential Distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** Poisson Distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** Poisson distribution is used to model the number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time or space, such as the number of cars passing through a toll booth in an hour or the number of calls received by a call center in a day.\n",

    "### 3. Which probability distribution is symmetric and bell-shaped?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Binomial Distribution\n",
    "- Poisson Distribution\n",
    "- Normal Distribution\n",
    "- Exponential Distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** Normal Distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** Normal distribution is symmetric and bell-shaped. It is widely used to model many natural phenomena, such as the heights and weights of people and the errors in measurements.\n",

    "### 4. In a binomial distribution, what is the formula for calculating the probability of k successes in n trials?\n",
    "\n",
    "- P(k) = nCk * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n",
    "- P(k) = e^(-λ) * λ^k / k!\n",
    "- P(k) = μ + σZ\n",
    "- P(k) = λ^k * e^(-λ) / k!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** P(k) = nCk * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** This is the formula for the probability of k successes in n trials, where p is the probability of success and (1-p) is the probability of failure.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. In a Poisson distribution, what is the formula for calculating the probability of k events occurring in a fixed time interval?\n",
    "\n",
    "- P(k) = nCk * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k)\n",
    "- P(k) = e^(-λ) * λ^k / k!\n",
    "- P(k) = μ + σZ\n",
    "- P(k) = λ^k * e^(-λ) / k!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** P(k) = λ^k * e^(-λ) / k!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** This is the formula for the probability of k events occurring in a fixed time interval, where λ is the expected number of events in that time interval.\n",

    "\n",
    "### 6. In a normal distribution, what is the percentage of data that falls within one standard deviation of the mean?\n",
    "\n",
    "- 68%\n",
    "- 95%\n",
    "- 99.7%\n",
    "- 100%\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** 68%\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** In a normal distribution, approximately 68% of data falls within one standard deviation of the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. In a binomial distribution, what happens to the shape of the distribution as the number of trials increases?\n",
    "\n",
    "- It becomes wider\n",
    "- It becomes narrower\n",
    "- It becomes taller\n",
    "- It becomes flatter\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** It becomes narrower\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** As the number of trials in a binomial distribution increases, the shape of the distribution becomes narrower and more concentrated around the expected value.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "- It becomes narrower\n",
    "- It becomes taller\n",
    "- It becomes flatter\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** It becomes taller\n",
