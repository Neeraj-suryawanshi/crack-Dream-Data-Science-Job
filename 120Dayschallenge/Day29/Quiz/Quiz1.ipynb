    "### 1. What is the difference between a probability mass function (PMF) and a probability density function (PDF)?\n",
    "\n",
    "- A PMF is continuous, while a PDF is discrete.\n",
    "- A PMF is used for continuous random variables, while a PDF is used for discrete random variables.\n",
    "- A PMF gives the probability of a specific outcome, while a PDF gives the probability density of an outcome.\n",
    "- A PMF and a PDF are equivalent terms.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** A PMF gives the probability of a specific outcome, while a PDF gives the probability density of an outcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** The PMF is used for discrete random variables, while the PDF is used for continuous random variables.\n",

    "### 2. What does the cumulative density function (CDF) represent?\n",
    "\n",
    "- The probability of a specific outcome.\n",
    "- The probability density of an outcome.\n",
    "- The cumulative probability up to a specific value.\n",
    "- The expected value of a random variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** The cumulative probability up to a specific value.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** The CDF gives the probability that a random variable takes on a value less than or equal to a specific value.\n",

    "### 3. Which of the following is an example of a normal distribution?\n",
    "\n",
    "- The distribution of the number of heads obtained from flipping a fair coin.\n",
    "- The distribution of the sum of two dice rolls.\n",
    "- The distribution of heights of adult humans.\n",
    "- The distribution of the number of cars passing through a toll booth in one hour.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** The distribution of heights of adult humans.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** The normal distribution is often used to model the distribution of real-world data, such as the heights of people.\n",

    "- F(x) = P(X >= x)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** F(x) = P(X < x)\n",
    "\n",

    "### 6. What is the Bernoulli distribution?\n",
    "\n",
    "- A distribution used to model the number of successes in a sequence of independent trials.\n",
    "- A distribution used to model the number of occurrences of a particular event in a fixed interval of time.\n",
    "- A distribution used to model the number of people in a certain age group.\n",
    "- A distribution used to model the number of defective items in a production batch.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** A distribution used to model the number of successes in a sequence of independent trials.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** The Bernoulli distribution is a discrete probability distribution with only two possible outcomes (success or failure) in a single trial.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. What is the Uniform distribution?\n",
    "\n",
    "- A distribution used to model the number of occurrences of a particular event in a fixed interval of time.\n",
    "- A distribution used to model the number of people in a certain age group.\n",
    "- A continuous probability distribution with a constant probability density between two limits.\n",
    "- A discrete probability distribution with equal probabilities for all outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** A continuous probability distribution with a constant probability density between two limits.\n",

    "### 8. What are Z-scores used for?\n",
    "\n",
    "- To standardize a normal distribution.\n",
