    "\n",
    "   **Answer: B**\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Explanation: In Bokeh, Glyphs are visual shapes that are used to represent the data points in a plot. They define the basic geometry of the plot, such as the shape, size, and color of the markers used to represent the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Which of the following functions is used to create a scatter plot in Bokeh?\n",
    "\n",
    "   - A. bokeh.plotting.line()\n",

    "   - C. bokeh.plotting.scatter()\n",
    "   - D. bokeh.plotting.heatmap()\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Answer: C**\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Explanation: The `bokeh.plotting.scatter()` function is used to create a scatter plot in Bokeh. This function takes the x and y coordinates of the data points as inputs, along with optional parameters for customizing the appearance and interactivity of the plot.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. What is a Bokeh widget?\n",
    "\n",
    "   - A. A tool for styling the appearance of the plot\n",
    "   - B. A data structure for storing data in Bokeh\n",
    "   - C. An interactive control element in a Bokeh plot\n",
    "   - D. A programming interface for accessing Bokeh features\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Answer: C**\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Explanation: Bokeh widgets are interactive control elements that can be added to a Bokeh plot to allow users to change the data being displayed or to adjust the appearance of the plot. Examples of Bokeh widgets include sliders, dropdown menus, and buttons.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Which of the following statements is true about Bokeh layouts?\n",
    "\n",
    "   - A. They are used to specify the location of the widgets in a plot\n",
    "   - B. They are used to organize multiple plots in a single figure\n",
    "   - C. They are used to define the data points to be plotted\n",
    "   - D. They are used to specify the color scheme of the plot\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Answer: B**\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Explanation: Bokeh layouts are used to organize multiple plots in a single figure. They allow developers to create complex visualizations with multiple subplots, grids, and tabbed layouts.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Which of the following backends can be used to display Bokeh plots in a Jupyter notebook?\n",
    "\n",
    "   - A. bokeh.io.output_notebook()\n",
    "   - B. bokeh.io.output_file()\n",
    "   - C. bokeh.io.show()\n",
    "   - D. All of the above\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Answer: A**\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Explanation: The `bokeh.io.output_notebook()` function is used to display Bokeh plots in a Jupyter notebook. This function initializes the Bokeh library to work in the Jupyter notebook environment and enables the notebook output mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. How do you create a scatter plot using Bokeh?\n",
    "\n",
    "   - A. using the bokeh.plotting.scatter() function\n",
    "   - B. using the bokeh.plotting.line() function\n",
    "   - C. using the bokeh.plotting.bar() function\n",
