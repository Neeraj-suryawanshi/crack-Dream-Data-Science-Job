    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** Option A is incorrect because it only iterates over the elements in the array but doesn't modify them. Option B is a correct method to iterate over the elements in a 2D Numpy array and modify them based on a condition, but it's not the most efficient way. Option C uses Numpy's advanced indexing and broadcasting capabilities to modify elements in the array that meet the condition in a single line of code, making it the most efficient and concise method."
