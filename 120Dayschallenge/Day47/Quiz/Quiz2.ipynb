    "### 1. Which of the following is a technique for tuning hyperparameters that exhaustively searches a specified subset of the hyperparameter space?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Randomize search cv\n",
    "- Data leakage\n",
    "- Confusion matrix\n",
    "- Grid search cv\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** Grid search cv\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** Grid search cv is a technique that exhaustively searches a specified subset of the hyperparameter space.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Which of the following is a technique for tuning hyperparameters that randomly samples a specified subset of the hyperparameter space?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data leakage\n",
    "- Confusion matrix\n",
    "- Randomize search cv\n",
    "- Grid search cv\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** Randomize search cv\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** Randomize search cv is a technique that randomly samples a specified subset of the hyperparameter space.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. What is data leakage?\n",
    "\n",
    "- When data is accidentally or intentionally leaked to the public\n",
    "- When the test data is used to train the model\n",
    "- When the training data contains information that would not be available in the real world\n",
    "- None of the above\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** When the training data contains information that would not be available in the real world\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** Data leakage occurs when the training data contains information that would not be available in the real world, leading to overfitting and inaccurate results.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Which of the following is a tool used to evaluate the performance of a classification model?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Grid search cv\n",
    "- Randomize search cv\n",
    "- Data leakage\n",
    "- Confusion matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** Confusion matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** A confusion matrix is a tool used to evaluate the performance of a classification model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. What is the precision of a model?\n",
    "\n",
    "- The number of true positives divided by the number of false positives\n",
    "- The number of true positives divided by the sum of true positives and false negatives\n",
    "- The number of true positives divided by the sum of true positives and false positives\n",
    "- The number of true negatives divided by the sum of true negatives and false positives\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** The number of true positives divided by the sum of true positives and false positives\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** Precision measures the proportion of true positives out of all predicted positives.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. What is the recall of a model?\n",
    "\n",
    "- The number of true positives divided by the sum of true positives and false negatives\n",
    "- The number of true positives divided by the sum of true positives and false positives\n",
    "- The number of true positives divided by the number of false positives\n",
    "- The number of true negatives divided by the sum of true negatives and false positives\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** The number of true positives divided by the sum of true positives and false negatives\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** Recall measures the proportion of true positives out of all actual positives.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. What is the F1 score of a model?\n",
    "\n",
    "- The weighted average of precision and recall\n",
    "- The harmonic mean of precision and recall\n",
    "- The arithmetic mean of precision and recall\n",
    "- None of the above\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** The harmonic mean of precision and recall\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** The F1 score is a weighted average of precision and recall, with more emphasis on the smaller value.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. Which of the following hyperparameters can be tuned using grid search cv for a logistic regression classifier?\n",
    "\n",
    "- C\n",
    "- Penalty\n",
    "- L1 ratio\n",
    "- n_neighbors\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** L1 ratio\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** The hyperparameters that can be tuned using grid search cv for a logistic regression classifier are C and the choice of penalty ('l1' or 'l2').\n"
