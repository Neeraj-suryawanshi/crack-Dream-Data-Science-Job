    "### 1. Which of the following data types can be stored in a list?\n",
    "\n",
    "- 1. int, float, complex\n",
    "- 2. str, list, tuple, set\n",
    "- 3. dict, NoneType, bytes\n",
    "- 4. bool, frozenset, range\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** 1, 2, 3, and 4 are correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** A list is a collection datatype in Python that can store multiple items of different datatypes in a single list variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Which of the following is correct for a list?\n",
    "\n",
    "- 1. List can be indexed.\n",
    "- 2. Lists can be sliced.\n",
    "- 3. Lists can be concatenated.\n",
    "- 4. Lists items can be reassigned.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** All statements are correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** Lists can be indexed, sliced, concatenated, and item reassignment is possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Which of the following is correct for a list?\n",
    "\n",
    "- 1. List is unordered.\n",
    "- 2. List is mutable.\n",
    "- 3. List allows duplicate.\n",
    "- 4. Lists allow users to store only a single data type.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** All statements are correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** The list is ordered, mutable, allows duplicates, and can store multiple data types.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Which of the following list methods definition is correct?\n",
    "\n",
    "- 1. append(): Adds an element at the end of the list.\n",
    "- 2. extend(): Add the elements of any iterable to the end of the current list.\n",
    "- 3. remove(): Removes the item with the specified value.\n",
    "- 4. pop(): Adds an element at the specified position.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** 1, 2, and 3 are correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** append(), extend(), and remove() are correct list methods. However, the definition for pop() provided is incorrect; the correct definition for pop() is to remove the element at the specified position.\n",

    "**Question:5** What will be the output of the following code:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "list_out=[]\n",
    "\n",
    "for i in range(0,51,10):\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "print(list_out)\n",

    "**Options:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    " [0, 10, 20, 30, 40]\n",
    "\n",
    " ['0', '10', '20', '30', '40']\n",

    "\n",
    " [0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50]\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Answer:** \n",
    " ['0', '10', '20', '30', '40', '50']\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** The for loop runs over a range of 1 to 50 with a step size of 10. In each iteration, the value of i is converted to a string datatype and is appended to the list_out list.\n",

    "**Question 6:**\n",
    "Which of the following is correct for a tuple?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Tuple is ordered.\n",
    "2. Tuple is mutable.\n",
    "3. Tuple allows duplicate.\n",
    "4. The following is not a tuple: (45, )\n",
    "\n",
    "Options:\n",
    "- 1 and 2 are correct.\n",
    "- 1 and 3 are correct.\n",
    "- 1, 2, 3, and 4 are correct.\n",
    "- None\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: 1 and 3 are correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation: The Tuple is ordered, immutable, and allows duplicate items. Also, if the user does not assign a comma after adding a single item in the tuple, then that variable will not be a tuple. In this case, if the comma is removed, then the data type of the variable thus created will be int.\n",

    "**Question 7:**\n",
    "Is Item assignment allowed in tuples?\n",

    "- False\n",
    "- Insufficient data\n",
    "- None\n",

    "**Question:8**Select the correct option for the following code:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "numbers = (1,2,3,4,5, 5,4,3,2,1)\n",
    "\n",
    "list=[]\n",

    "   list.append(number**2)\n",

    "{1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 25, 16, 9, 4, 1}\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Answer:**{1, 4, 9, 16, 25}\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    " In the above code for loop iterates in numbers tuple. Each number in every iteration is squared and appended to a list. This list is the typecasted to set and all the duplicate items are removed.\n",

    "### Set Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 9:**\n",
    "Which two methods are used to join the two sets?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. + and join()\n",
    "2. union() and update()\n",
    "3. append() and extend()\n",
    "4. None\n",
    "\n",
    "Options:\n",
    "- 1, and 2 are correct.\n",
    "- 1, and 3 are correct.\n",
    "- 1, 2, 3, and 4 are correct.\n",
    "- 2, and 3 are correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: 2 and 3 are correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation: `union()` method returns a new set containing all the items from both sets after removing duplicates if any. `update()` method inserts all the items from one set to another after removing duplicates if any.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 10:**\n",
    "Which of the following methods are used for tuples and sets?\n",
    "\n",
    "Tuples: count() and index() Tuples: append() and extend() Sets: add(), pop() and union() Sets: union(), update(), and index()\n",

    "- 1 and 3 are correct.\n",

    "- 2, and 3 are correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: 2, and 3 are correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation: `count()` and `index()` are the only methods available for tuples. This is because tuples are immutable. `add()`, `pop()`, `union()`, and `update()` are methods for the set, but `index()` is used for lists and tuples.\n",
