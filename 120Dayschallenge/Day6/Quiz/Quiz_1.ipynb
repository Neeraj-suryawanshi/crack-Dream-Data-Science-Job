    "1. Which of the following are the type-casting methods in Python Programming language?\n",
    "   - 1. int()\n",
    "   - 2. type()\n",
    "   - 3. float()\n",
    "   - 4. str()\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Options:\n",
    "   - 1 and 2\n",
    "   - 1, 3 and 4\n",
    "   - 1, 2, and 3 \n",
    "   - 1, 2, 3 and 4 \n",
    "\n",
    "   **Answer**: 1, 3 and 4\n",
    "   **Explanation**: type() is an inbuilt python method used to check the type of any variable in python. int(), str() and float() are basic type casting methods in python. Apart from this list(), tuple(), dict() are also some examples of type-casting methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Choose the option containing all correct Keywords in Python Programming Language?\n",
    "   - False, True, None\n",
    "   - Class, def, continue\n",
    "   - import, from global\n",
    "   - or, yield, generator\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Options:\n",
    "   - 1 and 2 are correct\n",
    "   - 1, 2, and 3 are correct \n",
    "   - 1, 3, and 4 are correct\n",
    "   - All are correct\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Answer**: 1 and 2 are correct\n",
    "   **Explanation**: In the fourth statement, generator is not a keyword.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. What will be the output of the following code: 1/ False\n",
    "   - inf \n",
    "   - ZeroDivisionError \n",
    "   - Zero\n",
    "   - None\n",
    "   \n",
    "   **Answer**: ZeroDivisionError\n",
    "   **Explanation**: Internally False has a value of zero. Mathematically 1 divided by zero is infinity or not defined. So Python gives ZeroDivisionError (division by zero).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Is python a dynamically typed Programming language?\n",
    "   - True\n",
    "   - False \n",
    "   - Can’t say\n",
    "   - None\n",
    "   \n",
    "   **Answer**: True\n",
    "   **Explanation**: We are not required to declare the type of variable while variable declaration. Data type is assigned during the runtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. What will be the output of the following code:\n",
    "   - num1= 23\n",
    "   - num2= 44\n",
    "   - num2= 2+3j\n",
    "   - num1= num2.imag\n",
    "   - num2-num1\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Options:\n",
    "   - 21 \n",
    "   - -21 \n",
    "   - -1+3j \n",
    "   - 1-3j\n",
    "   \n",
    "   **Answer**: 1-3j\n",
    "   **Explanation**: While subtracting num2 from num1, (2+3j) - (3 + 0j ), the real part is subtracted from the real part and the imaginary part is subtracted from the imaginary part.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Choose the correct code from the options to rectify the following incorrect code:\n",
    "   - ‘Pwskills’ + 1\n",
    "   - int(‘pwskills’) + 1 \n",
    "   - int(‘pwskills’) + int(1) \n",
    "   - ‘pwskills’ + type(1)\n",
    "   - pwskills’ + str(1)\n",
    "   \n",
    "   **Answer**: int('pwskills') + 1\n",
    "   **Explanation**: The addition of two same data types is only possible. str with str and int with int.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Please select the legally allowed variable names from the below given variable names:\n",
    "   - 1. 20%_num \n",
    "   - 2. Num_100   \n",
    "   - 3. Pw-skills   \n",
    "   - 4. _pw_skills\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Options:\n",
    "   - 1 and 2 are correct \n",
    "   - 1 and 4 are correct\n",
    "   - 1, 2, and 4 are correct. \n",
    "   - 2 and 4 are correct.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   **Answer**: 1 and 4 are correct\n",
    "   **Explanation**: Guidelines for variable nomenclature in python. A variable name must start with a letter or an underscore. A variable name cannot start with a number. A variable name can only contain letters, numbers, and underscores.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. What is the correct way to define a multiline string?\n",
    "   - A string enclosed in single triple quotes\n",
    "   - A string enclosed in double triple quotes\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Options:\n",
    "   - 1 only \n",
    "   - 2 only \n",
    "   - 1 and 2  \n",
    "   - None\n",
    "   \n",
    "   **Answer**: 1 and 2\n",
    "   **Explanation**: Multiline strings can be created using single triple quotes and double triple quotes.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. What will be the output of the following code:\n",
    "   - Name = ‘pwskills’\n",
    "   - Name[0] = ‘P’\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Options:\n",
    "   - pwskills\n",
    "   - Pwskills  \n",
    "   - TypeError \n",
    "   - . Ppwskills \n",
    "   \n",
    "   **Answer**: TypeError\n",
    "   **Explanation**: String object does not support item assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. What will be the output of the following code:\n",
    "   - ‘pwskills’.upper().lower().isalnum()\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Options:\n",
    "   - False\n",
    "   - PWSKILLS \n",
    "   - True\n",
    "   - pwskills \n",
    "   \n",
    "   **Answer**: True\n",
    "   **Explanation**: First string is converted to uppercase, then it is converted to lowercase and finally it checks if the string is alphanumeric.\n"
