    "**Question:1** What is the output of the following code?\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = 5\n",
    "\n",
    "if x > 10:\n",
    "\n",
    "    print(\"x is greater than 10\")\n",
    "\n",
    "else:\n",
    "\n",
    "    print(\"x is not greater than 10\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Options:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x is not greater than 10\n",
    "\n",
    "x is greater than\n",
    "\n",
    "Both a & b\n",
    "\n",
    "None of the above\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Answer:** x is not greater than 10\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** The code tests if x is greater than 10. Since x is 5, the condition x > 10 is False, and the code in the else block is executed.\n",

    "**Question:2** Can if statement have multiple elif clauses in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Options:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, an if statement can have multiple elif clauses in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "No, an if statement cannot hold multiple clauses\n",
    "\n",
    "Both a & b\n",
    "\n",
    "None of the above\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Answer:** Yes, an if statement can have multiple elif clauses in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** The elif statement is used to test additional conditions if the previous if or elif conditions are False. You can use multiple elif clauses to test multiple conditions, and only the first True condition will be executed. If all the conditions are False, the code in the else block, if present, will be executed.\n",

    "**Question:3** Which of the following is not a type of loop in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Options:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for loop\n",
    "\n",
    "while loop\n",
    "\n",
    "do-while loop\n",
    "\n",
    "foreach loop\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Answer:**foreach loop\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** Python does not have a foreach loop. The two most common types of loops in Python are the for loop and the while loop. The for loop is used to iterate over a sequence, such as a list or a string, and the while loop is used to repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.\n",

    "**Question:4** What is the output of the following code?\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for i in range(1, 5):\n",
    "\n",
    "    print(i)\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Options:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "0 1 2 3 4\n",

    "1 2 3 4\n",
    "\n",
    "0 1 2 3\n",
    "\n",
    "5\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Answer:** 1 2 3 4\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** The code defines a for loop that iterates over the range object from 1 to 4. On each iteration, the value of i is printed. The output is the sequence of numbers 1 to 4.\n",

    "**Question:5** What is the output of the following code?\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\n",
    "i = 0\n",
    "\n",
    "while i < 5:\n",
    "\n",
    "    print(i)\n",

    "    i += 1\n",

    "\n",
    "0 1 2 3\n",
    "\n",
    "5\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Answer:** 0 1 2 3 4\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** The code defines a while loop that runs as long as i is less than 5. On each iteration, the value of i is printed and then increased by 1. The output is the sequence of numbers 0 to 4.\n",
