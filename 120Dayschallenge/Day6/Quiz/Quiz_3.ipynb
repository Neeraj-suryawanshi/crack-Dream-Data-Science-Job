    "- 1, 3, and 4\n",
    "- 1, 2, and 3\n",
    "- 2, 3, and 4\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** 1, 3, and 4\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** The `for` keyword is used to create a loop, while `break`, `continue`, and `pass` keywords are used to control the flow of the loop.\n",

    "### 2. Iteration with Loop\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** Which of the following can be iterated using a for loop or a while loop?\n",

    "### 3. Loop Output\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** What will be the output of the following code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for course in ['Data Science Masters', 'ML', 'data science masters', 'DL']:\n",
    "    if len(course) != 2:\n",

    "- Pwskills Pwskills\n",
    "- Pwskills\n",
    "- Pwskills Pwskills Pwskills\n",
    "- None\n",

    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "'PwSkills' is printed for each course whose length is not equal to 2.\n",

    "**Question:4** What will be the output of the following code:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "sum = 0\n",
    "\n",
    "for i in range(1,100):\n",
    "\n",
    "    sum += i\n",

    "        break\n",
    "\n",
    "print(sum)\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Options:**\n",
    "- A number equal to 100\n",
    "- A number less than 100\n",
    "- A number greater than 100\n",
    "- None\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** A number greater than 100 \n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** The loop will start summing up the numbers from 1 to 100. In each iteration, the sum of the numbers will increase. When the sum value will be greater than 100 the loop will be terminated. So the Sum will be a number greater than 100.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:5**What will be the output of the following code:\n",
    "\n",
    " ```python\n",
    " i=0\n",
    "\n",
    "while i< 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "    print('pwskills')\n",
    " \n",

    "**Options:**\n",
    "- Infinite loop\n",
    "- 100 times pwskills\n",
    "- 200 times pwskills\n",
    "- None\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** Infinite loop\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** Initially i is equal to zero. For the first iteration i<1, therefore the loop will print pwskills. But as we have not incremented the value of i after the print statement, The while loop will run infinitely.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "**Question:6**Choose the correct one for the given below statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "- for loop cannot be used with range().\n",
    "- for loop can be used with an if else statement.\n",
    "- for loop can be used with the break, continue and pass keywords.\n",

    "**Options:**\n",
    "- True, False, False\n",
    "- True, True, True\n",
    "- False, True, True\n",
    "- False, False, False\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** False, True, True\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** for loop can be used with the range method. for loop can also be used with conditional statements and with loop control keywords.\n",

    "**Question:7**What is the purpose of the following code?\n",
    "```python\n",
    "num = 2\n",
    "\n",
    "sum = 0\n",
    "\n",
    "while num <=20:\n",

    "**Options:**\n",
    "- Sum of first 10 Even numbers\n",
    "- Sum of first 10 Natural numbers\n",
    "- Sum of first 10 Odd Numbers\n",
    "- None\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** Sum of first 10 Even numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** The program runs till the number is less than or equal to 20. The initial value of num is 2, which is even. Also, the num is incremented by 2 in each iteration, which also results in an even number. The loop runs for a total of 10 times and finally prints the sum of the first 10 even numbers.\n",

    "- None\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** 1,2, and 3\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** ==, !=, >=, <=, >, and < are logical operators and can be used with if-else statements to check the logic of the given expression.\n",

    "- 3\n",
    "- 7\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** 1\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** The above code checks the vowels in string pwskills and if the vowel is present it prints True. As only i is a vowel in the given string so the program prints True once.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:10** Which of the following statements is correct?\n",
    "```pyhton \n",
    "1. for loop is typically used when we know how many times the loop is required to run.\n",
    "2. while loop repeats as long as its given condition is True.\n",
    "3. break keyword is used to terminate a for and while loop.\n",
    "4. pass keyword is used to skip the current iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Options:**\n",

    "**Answer:** 3\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**All of the above statements are well-known facts about for and while loop. break keyword is used to terminate a for and while loop. Whereas the pass keyword is used to skip the current iteration.\n"
