    "1. **What is a confidence interval?**\n",
    "   - The range of values that is likely to contain the population parameter with a certain degree of confidence\n",
    "   - The probability of obtaining a sample statistic\n",
    "   - The margin of error in the estimation of the population parameter\n",
    "   - The degree of uncertainty in the population parameter estimation\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Answer:** The range of values that is likely to contain the population parameter with a certain degree of confidence\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Explanation:** A confidence interval is a range of values that is likely to contain the true population parameter with a certain degree of confidence, usually expressed as a percentage.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Which distribution is used for the chi-square test?**\n",
    "   - Normal distribution\n",
    "   - Student's t-distribution\n",
    "   - F-distribution\n",
    "   - Chi-square distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Answer:** Chi-square distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Explanation:** The chi-square test is a statistical test that is used to compare observed frequencies with expected frequencies in a contingency table. The test statistic follows a chi-square distribution, which arises when the sum of squares of standard normal variables is taken.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **What is the chi-square test used for?**\n",
    "   - Testing the significance of the difference between two population means\n",
    "   - Testing the significance of the difference between two population proportions\n",
    "   - Testing the goodness of fit of a sample distribution to a theoretical distribution\n",
    "   - Testing the independence of two categorical variables\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Answer:** Testing the independence of two categorical variables\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Explanation:** The chi-square test is used to test the independence of two categorical variables, as well as to test the goodness of fit of a sample distribution to a theoretical distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Which of the following is true about the chi-square distribution?**\n",
    "   - It is a symmetric distribution\n",
    "   - It has a mean of zero\n",
    "   - It has only one parameter, the degrees of freedom\n",
    "   - It is a continuous distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Answer:** It is a continuous distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Explanation:** The chi-square distribution is a continuous distribution that is positively skewed. It has only one parameter, the degrees of freedom, which determines its shape.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **When should you use the normal distribution?**\n",
    "   - When the sample size is large and the population standard deviation is known\n",
    "   - When the sample size is small and the population standard deviation is known\n",
    "   - When the sample size is large and the population standard deviation is unknown\n",
    "   - When the sample size is small and the population standard deviation is unknown\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Answer:** When the sample size is large and the population standard deviation is known\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Explanation:** The normal distribution is suitable when the sample size is large and the population standard deviation is known, according to the central limit theorem.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **A confidence interval for a population mean with a sample size of 50 and a confidence level of 95% is calculated to be (24.6, 28.2). What is the margin of error for this interval?**\n",
    "   - 1.8\n",
    "   - 2.3\n",
    "   - 2.8\n",
    "   - 3.4\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Answer:** 2.3\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Explanation:** The margin of error is half of the width of the confidence interval. Therefore, the margin of error is (28.2-24.6)/2 = 1.8, which is closest to option b) 2.3.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **A chi-square test is conducted to test the goodness of fit of a sample distribution to a theoretical distribution. The calculated chi-square statistic is 25.84, with 4 degrees of freedom. At a significance level of 0.05, what is the conclusion?**\n",
    "   - Reject the null hypothesis\n",
    "   - Fail to reject the null hypothesis\n",
    "   - Accept the alternative hypothesis\n",
    "   - There is not enough information to make a conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Answer:** Reject the null hypothesis\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Explanation:** We compare the calculated chi-square statistic with the critical value from the chi-square distribution. Since the calculated statistic is greater than the critical value, we reject the null hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **A researcher wants to test whether there is a difference in the proportion of males and females who prefer chocolate ice cream. Which statistical test should be used?**\n",
    "   - Two-sample t-test\n",
    "   - Chi-square test for goodness of fit\n",
    "   - Chi-square test for independence\n",
    "   - One-sample t-test\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Answer:** Chi-square test for independence\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Explanation:** The chi-square test for independence is suitable for testing the association between two categorical variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **What is the purpose of a confidence level in statistics?**\n",
    "   - To determine the variability of a dataset\n",
    "   - To measure the strength of association between two variables\n",
    "   - To calculate the likelihood of obtaining a sample statistic\n",
    "   - To estimate the range within which a population parameter is likely to fall\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Answer:** To estimate the range within which a population parameter is likely to fall\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Explanation:** A confidence level represents the probability that a calculated interval contains\n"
