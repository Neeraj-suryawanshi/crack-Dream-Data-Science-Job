    "## Python Lambda, Map, Reduce, and Filter\n",

    "**Question 1**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **What does the lambda function in Python do?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Options:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* creates an infinite loop\n",
    "* creates a named function\n",
    "* creates an anonymous function  (Answer)\n",
    "* None of the above\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** Lambda functions are small, one-line functions without a name, used for short-term tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 2**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **What does the map function in Python do?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Options:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* returns the first element in a list\n",
    "* applies a function to each element in a list and returns a list of the results  (Answer)\n",
    "* returns the last element in a list\n",
    "* None of the above\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** Map applies a function to each iterable element and returns a new iterable with the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 3**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **What does the reduce function in Python do?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Options:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* applies a function to each element in a list and returns a list of the results\n",
    "* applies a function cumulatively to elements of an iterable, from left to right  (Answer)\n",
    "* returns the first element in a list\n",
    "* None of the above\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** Reduce applies a function cumulatively to iterable elements, producing a single value.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 4**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **What does the filter function in Python do?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Options:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* returns a filtered list of elements that satisfy a condition  (Answer)\n",
    "* returns the first element in a list\n",
    "* returns the last element in a list\n",
    "* None of the above\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** Filter returns a new iterable with elements that meet a specified condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 5**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **What is the output of the following code?**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "squared_numbers = map(lambda x: x**2, numbers)\n",
    "print(list(squared_numbers))\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Options:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* [0, 1, 4, 9, 16]\n",
    "* [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]\n",
    "* [1, 4, 9, 16, 25] (Answer)\n",
    "* None of the above\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** In this code, the map function is applied to each element in the list \"numbers\" using the lambda function, which squares each element. The result is a list of squared numbers, which is [1, 4, 9, 16, 25].\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 6**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **What is the output of the following code?**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from functools import reduce\n",
    "numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "product = reduce(lambda x, y: x*y, numbers)\n",
    "print(product)\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Options:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* 120 (Answer)\n",
    "* 30\n",
    "* 15\n",
    "* None of the above\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**  In this code, the reduce function is applied to the list \"numbers\" using the lambda function, which multiplies two elements. The result is the product of all elements in the list, which is 120.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 7**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **What is the output of the following code?**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "even_numbers = filter(lambda x: x%2 == 0, numbers)\n",
    "print(list(even_numbers))\n",

    "* [1, 3, 5]\n",
    "* [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "* None of the above\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:** \n",
    "\n",
    "*  In this code, the filter function is applied to the list \"numbers\" using the lambda function, which checks if each element is even. The result is a filtered list of even numbers, which is [2, 4].\n",
