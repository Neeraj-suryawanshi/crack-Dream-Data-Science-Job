    "**Question 1:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* What is the purpose of a function in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Options:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* To break up a program into smaller, reusable pieces of code\n",
    "* To store data in memory\n",
    "* To perform a specific task or set of tasks\n",
    "* To control the flow of a program\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* To break up a program into smaller, reusable pieces of code\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions promote code organization, reduce redundancy, and make code easier to maintain and modify.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 2:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* What is the syntax for defining a function in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Options:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* define function_name(arguments):\n",
    "* function function_name(arguments):\n",
    "* def function_name(arguments):\n",
    "* create function_name(arguments):\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* def function_name(arguments):\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `def` keyword is used to declare functions, followed by the function name and arguments in parentheses.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 3:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* What is parameter passing in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Options:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* The process of sending data to a function as input\n",
    "* The process of storing data in memory\n",
    "* The process of returning data from a function\n",
    "* The process of manipulating data in a function\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* The process of sending data to a function as input\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Parameters allow functions to receive data from the caller for processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 4:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* What is the purpose of iterators in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Options:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* To repeat a block of code a specified number of times\n",
    "* To allow for efficient access to elements in a sequence one at a time\n",
    "* To store data in memory\n",
    "* To manipulate data in a function\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* To allow for efficient access to elements in a sequence one at a time\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Iterators conserve memory when working with large datasets by accessing elements one by one.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 5:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* What is a generator function in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Options:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* A function that generates a sequence of values\n",
    "* A function that creates an iterator\n",
    "* A function that performs a specific task or set of tasks\n",
    "* A function that breaks up a program into smaller, reusable pieces of code\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* A function that generates a sequence of values\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Generators produce values as needed, improving memory efficiency, and return iterators for accessing those values.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 6:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* What is the difference between a normal function and a generator function in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Options:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Normal functions return a single value, while generator functions return an iterator\n",
    "* Normal functions use the return statement, while generator functions use the yield statement\n",
    "* Normal functions can only be used once, while generator functions can be used multiple times\n",
    "* Normal functions can only return numbers, while generator functions can return any type of data\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Normal functions return a single value, while generator functions return an iterator\n",
    "* Normal functions use the return statement, while generator functions use the yield statement\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Generators produce values on demand using `yield`, conserving memory and allowing for incremental generation.\n"
