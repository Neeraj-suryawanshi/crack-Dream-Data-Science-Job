    "   **Answer:** A\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Explanation:** A Web API is a set of standards and protocols for accessing web-based software applications or web tools. It provides a way for different software systems to communicate with each other over the internet.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. What is the primary purpose of a Web API?\n",
    "\n",
    "   - A. To create web pages\n",
    "   - B. To access and retrieve data from a remote server\n",
    "   - C. To provide a user interface for web-based applications\n",
    "   - D. None of the above\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Answer:** B\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Explanation:** The primary purpose of a Web API is to allow different software systems to access and retrieve data from a remote server.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. What is an API endpoint?\n",
    "\n",
    "   - A. A server that hosts an API\n",
    "   - B. A unique address that specifies the location of a server's API\n",
    "   - C. A graphical representation of API data\n",
    "   - D. None of the above\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Answer:** B\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Explanation:** An API endpoint is a unique address that specifies the location of a server's API.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. What is a REST API?\n",
    "\n",
    "   - A. A type of API that uses Representational State Transfer (REST) principles\n",
    "   - B. A software tool for testing API functionality\n",
    "   - C. A programming language used for creating APIs\n",
    "   - D. All of the above\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Answer:** A\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Explanation:** A REST API is a type of API that uses Representational State Transfer (REST) principles. It is designed to be lightweight, scalable, and easy to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. What is an API?\n",
    "\n",
    "   - A. An Application Programming Interface that allows software applications to interact with each other.\n",
    "   - B. A Web-based Application Programming Interface that allows software applications to interact over the internet.\n",
    "   - C. A software platform that provides a graphical user interface.\n",
    "   - D. All of the above\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Answer:** A\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Explanation:** An API allows two software applications to interact with each other by sharing data and functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. What are some common uses of Web APIs?\n",
    "\n",
    "   - A. Accessing databases and servers.\n",
    "   - B. Integrating third-party services and data into applications.\n",
    "   - C. Allowing applications to communicate with each other.\n",
    "   - D. Both A and B\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Answer:** D\n",
    "\n",
